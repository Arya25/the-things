        quote="The Things Network lets independent municipal leaders like myself walk down a path that was previously unavailable to government, a third way between a municipal build out of a Wide Area Network and a massive franchise agreement with a private corporation. Together with The Things Network, government may now organize in concert with a diverse coalition of partners to create and enhance services at the local community level. "
