      "The fundamental purpose of the organization is to build a network of technical experts to support students, teachers, researchers, experimenters and entrepreneurs in using remote sensing technology to advance our knowledge about and managament of physical processes in New York and around the world. Both to help build our own skills, and to help our users, we’re deploying the free-to-use Things Network throughout New York City. A key part of that effort is spreading the word about The Things Network and the benefits of joining an open IoT network. Outreach includes participating in hackathon and workshop events, presenting in various technology fora, and meeting with commercial, non-profit, and government organizations that might benefit from using TTN. In addition, the group recommends hardware, software and cloud solutions, and offer direct on-site support to people who want to deploy devices or a gateway.",

Frank started the things-nyc repo; then Terry forked the things-nyc repo and made even more extensive changes to support MCCI’s Catena boards, including adding all global band plans and doing extensive testing and bug fixing.

However, he would like to avoid having to visit the sensors to replace batteries every two weeks. Terry provided Brian with a set of Catena-based(find the repository link under extra links below) sensors as a first stage of the project. They work well communicating with a gateway high on the CUNY campus, but they still consume power at a higher rate than Brian would like. Frank and Forrest figured out the protocol for communicating with existing long-running off-the-shelf temperature sensors. Now Frank is putting together a communications board that will be able to transmit readings via LoRa while conserving power by going into deep sleep while inactive.",

Frank created the MapTheThings(link below) service as a fully open source alternative with scalability as a primary goal. The service summarizes successful and attempted transmissions into a multi-scale geo-hashed grid so that displaying data for any region on the globe requires a (roughly) constant and relatively small volume of data downloaded. The server is deployed on Heroku with SQS buffering and summary data is served directly from S3. On the node side, MapTheThings pairs a bluetooth and LoRa enabled node with an iOS app that tracks location and drives transmission of packets. A GPS-equipped LoRa node can also send location packets, but in this use case there is no tracking of attempted transmissions. The differnce between this and TTN Mapper is that the system stores information about failing uplinks, as well as succesful uplink. This is very useful for network modeling.",
